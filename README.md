# bartontools
bartontools.dpb.carnegiescience.edu Java web app

The web app runs under Tomcat and requires a number of additional Java packages that I'll list here later.
- The web app Java package, edu.carnegiescience.dpb.bartonlab is under /src.
- SQL used to build the database used by the web app is in /sql.

NOTE: /tools is being migrated to the bartonlab-java repo.
