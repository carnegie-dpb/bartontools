# bartontools
bartontools.dpb.carnegiescience.edu web app along with other useful analysis tools.

The web app, under /webapp, runs under Tomcat and requires a number of additional Java packages that I'll list here later. The web app Java package, edu.carnegiescience.dpb.bartonlab is under /src.

Other tools include:
- R code in /modeling 
- various command-line Java tools under /tools 
- sql used to build the database used by the web app in /sql 
- some handy sql for gbrowse databases under /gbrowse
